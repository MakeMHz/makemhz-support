## Overview
The Ring of Lights kit adds addressable RGB lighting to the inside of the Xbox top shell. This guide walks you through the steps needed to install the kit, including minimal internal modifications and proper cable routing to avoid interference with existing components.

Installation requires drilling two small holes for cable pass-through, removing the top RF shield, and carefully placing the LED ring inside the shell. No soldering is required, and the kit connects directly to Stellar.

## Disassembly
The top RF shielding needs to be remove to install the Ring of Lights kit. It can be removed by lifting up on the metal tabs.
